add prog

good developer follow below Rules
1. use meaning full names that describe the purpose of the variable
2. use camelCase for variables and functions, pascalcase for classes
3. Avoid using single character name except for loop counters. Eg:i,j

what is variable?
1.variable is like container/storage box that holds a value
2.variable allows us to store, retrive and modify the Data
3.variables can be declared using var,let and const keywords

Var 
1)variables declared with var can be redeclared
2)var is the only keyword used to create variables till 2015
3)let and const were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)

diffrences between var,let and const key words 
var
1)variables declared with var can be re-assigned and re-declared within the same scope
2)it is recommended to avoid using var in modern JavaScript.
let
1)variables declared with let can be re-assigned but can not be re-declared in the same scope
2)Preferred for variables that may need to change value
const
1)variables declared with const can not be re-assigned but  re-declared  But...
2)Bet for variables that should not be reassigned To avoid mistakes 

Expression 
 expression is any piece of code that produces a value when evaluated
Literal 
 A literal is a fixed value written directly in the code, such as numbers, strings, arrays and objects

 All the literals are called expressions 
 (``) template literals
 (``) template literals are very powerful
 expresion canb placed into template literals
Summary 
1)statements:Insstruction thst performed actions.
2)Expression:Parts of the code that evaluate to values.
3)Literals:Fixed values directly represented in the code. 

 JavaScript can only execute one instructio at a time that's why it is called single threaded
 ctrl+shift+i this short cut is used for browser console

Why JavaScript single threaded?
Synchronous and asynchronous Programming.
Synchronous:-
1)Synchronous Programming means that tasks are executed sequentilly, one after the other.
2)Each operation must complete before the next one begins.
3)In this model, the program execution is blocked until thr current task is finished
asynchronous:-
1)Tasks are ececuted independently of the main thread
2)Program can continue runing while waiting for other task to complete
3)In this model, the program execution is not blocked until the current task is finished
